These scenes are contributed by Akif Uslu, one of our previous students.
They have been modified by Deniz Sayin (also one of our students and TAs).
I think the changes include a more efficient vertex representation and
adding the shadingMode="smooth" flags. Also PLY versions of the trex and
Roosendaal models were created. You can change "smooth" to "flat" for flat
surface rendering mode. I've made some minor edits for fixing degenerate
triangles on some models.


I thank to both Akif and Deniz for their valuable contributions.
